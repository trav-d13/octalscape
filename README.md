# Octalscape
The concept behind the front-end visuals of Octal.

## Concept
Octal has origins in the technology and ultimately the world of bytes and binary. 
The concept revolves around creating images using a large matrix of binary numbers that render the image. 
Potential further functionality could give the appearance of a moving video.
